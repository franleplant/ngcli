> Work in progress

**ngcli**, the missing Angular.js part.

ngcli follows [John Papa's](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide) style guide.

## Motivation

Angular.js is great and there are a lot of nice patterns to follow in order to achieve
maximum maintainability and quality but those patterns come with a great deal of boilerplate,
this CLI utility attempts to automate boilerplate as much as it is possible in order
to deliver Angular apps that are well constructed, with high quality, easily maintainable and
easy to create.

If you make following this nice patterns and styles easier then more and more people will start
writing better Angular apps.

## Todo


ngcli is under development, there are a lot of things to do in order to achieve a first
usable version. Help is welcome.
